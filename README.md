Loom
=====
Loom is a new architecture for blockchain. It can achieve up to 710,000 transactions per second on a 1 gigabit network without data partitioning. Loom can eventually recover from a fault of any size, and it provides a way to cheaply verify a distributed ledger.

Bitcoin and Proof of Work is a phenomenal technical achievement. It’s a program that runs without interruption and is resilient to attacks and partitions. Scaling it has been a difficult challenge. 

Not only is scaling throughput a hard problem, but any high performance blockchain has to deal with an ever increasing mountain of data. Scaling bitcoin to just 25,000 transactions per second would create a petabyte of data each year.

We solve both of the problems by solving for time. The key innovation proposed by Loom is Proof of History — encoding passage of time as data into the ledger. Loom uses strong assumption of time to construct simpler and more efficient consensus and storage protocols.

data structures for the protocol, data types must have C layout, and no gaps
